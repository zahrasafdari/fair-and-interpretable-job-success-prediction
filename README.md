# Predicting Employee Performance and Job Success Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview

This project aims to predict employee performance and job success using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset includes various features such as demographic information, job-related data, performance metrics, and skills. The project also emphasizes fairness and interpretability to ensure ethical and unbiased predictions.

## Objective

- **Predict Employee Performance:** Utilize a rich dataset to forecast job success and performance based on various attributes.
- **Ensure Fairness:** Address fairness issues by evaluating and mitigating biases in the model.
- **Enhance Interpretability:** Use techniques like SHAP and LIME to explain model predictions.

## Dataset

The project uses the "HR Analytics Employee Performance" dataset, which includes:

- **Demographic Information:** Age, Gender, Ethnicity, etc.
- **Job-related Information:** Job Role, Department, Years of Experience, etc.
- **Performance Metrics:** Performance Rating, Projects Completed, etc.
- **Skills and Education:** Education Level, Skills, Certifications, etc.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Handling Missing Values:** Impute missing values using appropriate techniques.
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Convert categorical features to numerical ones using target encoding or embeddings.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features such as experience in years and skill diversity index.
4. **Data Normalization:** Normalize numerical features to ensure uniformity.

## Modeling

### Ensemble Methods

- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):** Utilize XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost for effective training.
- **Stacking:** Combine predictions from multiple models to create a meta-model.

### Deep Learning

- **Neural Networks:** Implement a deep neural network with multiple layers to capture complex patterns.

## Fairness and Bias Mitigation

1. **Fairness Metrics:** Evaluate fairness using metrics like disparate impact, equal opportunity, and demographic parity.
2. **Bias Mitigation Techniques:**
   - **Adversarial Debiasing:** Train the model with an adversarial network to minimize bias.
   - **Fair Representation Learning:** Learn a fair representation of the data that is invariant to protected attributes.

## Model Interpretability

1. **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** Explain model predictions globally and locally.
2. **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):** Provide local explanations for individual predictions.

## Model Evaluation and Validation

- **Performance Metrics:** Assess using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Fairness Metrics:** Measure fairness across different demographic groups.
- **Model Stability:** Evaluate stability using bootstrap sampling and cross-validation.

## Deployment and Monitoring

- **Deployment:** Implement the model in real-world applications, such as HR dashboards or decision support systems.
- **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor model performance and fairness in production, updating as necessary.
